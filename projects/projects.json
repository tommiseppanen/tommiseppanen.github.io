    "description": "After reading the book \"Programming in Haskell\" by Graham Huttom, I wanted to go back to the game of life example and implement own version of it with a graphical user interface. I did quick search of Haskell GUI libraries and found out that there exists Haskell bindings for Qt Quick. I was familiar with Qt but I didn't have any experience with QML so I decided that now is the perfect time to try it out.",
